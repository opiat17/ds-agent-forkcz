AI Agent for working with Discord
</div>


## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Always-On Mode**  
  Continuous operation: the bot stays running and sends messages on schedule, keeping the channel active around the clock.

- üïí **One-Time Mode**  
  Single execution: the bot carries out the specified actions and then stops. Perfect for one-off broadcasts or quick tests.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Token Checker**  
  Automatically verifies Discord tokens, flagging or removing invalid ones so you always work with a clean pool of accounts.

- ü§ñ **AI Message Sender**  
  Crafts natural replies by analyzing the last 100 messages in a chat via your chosen LLM (OpenAI or DeepSeek), making it feel like a real person joined the conversation.

- üì∑ **Media Sender**  
  Picks a random media file from the `media/` folder and posts it to the channel, simulating human-like behavior.

- üé≤ **Random Message Sender**  
  On a schedule, sends random messages (for example, ‚Äúgm‚Äù, ‚ÄúGN‚Äù, or any custom entries in your `RANDOM_MESSAGES` list) to boost visibility in the community.

- üåê **Support for Any LLM (OpenAI / DeepSeek)**  
  Easily swap providers‚Äîjust set `provider: "openai"` or `provider: "deepseek"` in your configuration. To add a new model, follow the pattern in `ai_agent/llm_wrapper.py`.

- üß† **NousResearch LLM Support**  
  Full support for cutting-edge models from [NousResearch](https://portal.nousresearch.com/) ‚Äî just set the provider in your config.  
  Available models:
  - `Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B`
  - `DeepHermes-3-Llama-3-8B-Preview`
  - `DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B-Preview`
  - `Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-405B`
  - `Hermes-4-70B` *(hybrid reasoning mode)*
  Use `provider: "nous"` in your `config.yaml` to integrate instantly.
  All Nous API requests reserve up to **32k tokens**, and for hybrid models the
  required reasoning system prompt is automatically prepended.

- üîÄ **Full Action Randomization**  
  Random delays between requests, varied message templates, and optional random token selection (`RANDOM_ACCOUNTS=true`) all combine to mimic a human user and reduce the chance of blocks.

- üìã **Detailed Logging**  
  Logs every step‚Äîfrom connection attempts to API errors. You can output logs to the console or save them to a file; everything is configurable via `config.yaml`.

- üîÅ **Automatic Retries**  
  If a temporary error occurs (rate limit, dropped connection, etc.), the bot will retry the action with configurable delays until it succeeds or hits the `RETRY_COUNT` limit.

- üì° **Socks5 Proxy Support**  
  Route traffic through Socks5 proxies to spread requests across different endpoints and protect your own IP address.

- üì¶ **Batch Account Processing**  
  When using a large number of accounts, tasks are split into batches (`BATCH_SIZE`) with pauses between each batch (`BATCH_DELAY`) to manage load and avoid overwhelming Discord.

- ü§ù **Flexible YAML Configuration**  
  Define servers, channels, message types, delay ranges, retry counts, and more‚Äîall in one `config.yaml` file. Tweak settings, and the bot adapts instantly.
